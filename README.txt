  $ clis3 list my_awesome_bucket/a_glob
  $ clis3 put my_awesome_bucket/a_key_name a_local_file
  $ cat a_local_file | clis3 put my_awesome_bucket/a_key_name
  $ clis3 put --data "this is the data" my_awesome_bucket/a_key_name
  $ clis3 get my_awesome_bucket/a_key_name a_local_file
  $ clis3 get my_awesome_bucket/a_key_name # Outputs to STDOUT
  $ clis3 cat my_awesome_bucket/a_key_name # Outputs to STDOUT, but adds an extra newline
  $ clis3 head my_awesome_bucket/a_key_name
    # Returns a YAML representation of response and metadata headers
  $ clis3 rm my_awesome_bucket/a_key_name

  Cliaws.s3.put(File.open("a_local_file", "rb"), "my_awesome_bucket/a_key_name")
  Cliaws.s3.put(STDIN, "my_awesome_bucket/a_key_name")
  Cliaws.s3.put("this is the data", "my_awesome_bucket/a_key_name")
  Cliaws.s3.get("my_awesome_bucket/a_key_name")
  Cliaws.s3.head("my_awesome_bucket/a_key_name")
