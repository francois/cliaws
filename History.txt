== 1.3.2 2008-10-25

* Removed dependency on ActiveSupport.

== 1.3.1 2008-10-06

* Relaxed ActiveSupport's dependency to ~> 2 instead of ~> 2.1.

== 1.3.0 2008-10-01

* Rewrote the algorithm for "clis3 put".  The new algorithm is saner, and prevents writing
  0 byte files when the input's size is unknown and cannot be determined.
* Return an exit status of 0 on normal exit on clis3 put.

== 1.2.5 2008-09-15

* More testing for "clis3 put - S3_OBJECT" and "cat x | clis3 put S3_OBJECT" highlighted
  errors.  Fixed those so now it works for real.
  WARNING:  "clis3 put - S3_OBJECT" is horribly broken: the stream's size is unknown and
            reported as 0, and the Amazon servers faithfully create a 0 sized object...

== 1.2.4 2008-09-15

* Released too soon - was missing some testing on clis3 put LOCAL REMOTE

== 1.2.3 2008-09-15

* clis3 put with one local argument was putting in a named folder on S3.

== 1.2.2 2008-08-25

* clis3 put was rewritten to work correctly with --data, stdin and multiple files.

== 1.2.1 2008-05-30

* clis3 put A bucket/ will put to bucket/A, while clis3 put A bucket/B will
  really put to bucket/B.  Essentially, the final slash treats the s3_object
  as a directory.

== 1.2.0 2008-05-30

* clis3 url returns the authenticated URL to an s3 object
* clisqs info subcommand
* Cliaws::Sqs#fetch returns a number of messages in one call
* clis3 put handles multiple arguments (put A B C bucket/dir)
* clis3 handles unknown bucket names gracefully

== 1.1.1 2008-04-17

* Renamed send to push for clisqs.

== 1.1.0 2008-04-17

* Implemented sqs command-line client.
* Cliaws::S3#get either returns the data, or writes the data to it's +dest+ parameter.

== 1.0.0 2008-04-12

* Implemented s3 command-line client.
